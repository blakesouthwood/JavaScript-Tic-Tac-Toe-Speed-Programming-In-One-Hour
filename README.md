# JavaScript-Tic-Tac-Toe-Speed-Programming-In-One-Hour
I wanted to see how fact I could code tic tac toe in JavaScript.
Listening to music with headphones in a quiet environment with no assistance 
from anyone else and not using the web I wanted to see how much of tic tac toe
could be built in JavaScript. I think it's a good demonstration of how fast
that I can think and write code. And it also shows fast fast I actually
can type too.
